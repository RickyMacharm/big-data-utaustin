To create and run the recommendation engine, use the following steps:

1. Run `build_recommender.py` to build the recommendation model.
2. Run `init_recommender.py` to get your own personal ratings and have them be saved to a text file.
3. Run `run_recommender.py` to run the recommender and see which movies you should watch!
